# Word Pyramid Decoder

The "Pyramid Decoder" is a Python script designed to decode messages represented as pyramids of words. Given a file containing numeric pairs and corresponding words, the script extracts relevant words and constructs a pyramid structure. The decoding process involves arranging words into rows based on the numeric sequence and then joining them to form the final decoded message. This versatile tool can be applied to various word-based encoding schemes, providing a flexible solution for decoding messages organized in a pyramid format.
